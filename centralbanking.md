## The technology

Our DLT Core Solution is based on Hyperledger Iroha, a fast and effective permissioned blockchain and distributed ledger. Iroha can handle millions of account holders making tens of millions of transactions every day, as fast or faster than any modern bank transfer.
Iroha's crash-fault tolerant consensus protocol keeps information about every account and transaction securely and reliably.

There are different possible configurations of the system with respect to the number of nodes and location of the payment gateways.

Relevant code base for existing Soramitsu projects have been audited by Nettitude
